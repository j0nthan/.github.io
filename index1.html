    <h2>About <mark>Time Management?</mark></h2>
    <p>Time management is when you effectively plan your time for each specific activity you have planned for <br> that period of time. Many successful people use time management to use their time wisely to complete <br> their tasks so they don't have to work smarter, not harder, meaning that they can produce quality work <br> instead of rushing to not miss a deadline, meaning you stressed and producing work that is not as good <br> as what you could've produced if you had time and managed your time wisely.</p>
