    <h2>Benefit of <mark>Time Management</mark></h2>
    <p>One of the many benefits of time management is that it allows you to complete things you have set out to do for the <br> day. This can be things like doing homework or preparing for a test. By using time management, you can efficiently <br> complete these activities and others in less time. This allows you to have more time for the things you love, like sports, <br>  playing video games, or hanging out with friends. But the overall benefit of time management is that time management <br>  improves your workflow, which also benefits and helps other parts of your life.</p>
